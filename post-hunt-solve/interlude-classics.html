        <h4>Metameta solved!</h4>
        <p>You BACK A LORRY AT HIM THEN EARN A MONSTER&rsquo;S DEBRIS.  As the truck slams into Dean Martian, he wails: &ldquo;Noooo! The Earth was mine for the taking, and you NERDS ruined it all!&rdquo; Moments later, his body explodes, raining gristle and goo down around you. It&rsquo;s... gross.

        <p>As you catch your breath you have a chance to think back on the time you spent at Puzzle University – all of the courses you took, and scary monsters you defeated.  It&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s been a whirlwind scholarship and you have no idea how you actually made it through, but you are suddenly struck by a terrible thought: perhaps there&rsquo;s no one left who can grant you your degree! But another school administrator leaps to your aid...

    </div>
    
    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-54" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Sociology solved</h4>
        <p>You flood the School Bullies&rsquo; feeds with CLIQUE BAIT and they wander off, distracted by top ten lists and quizzes about which Mean Girls character they are.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-157" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Sociology open</h4>
        <p>The SCHOOL BULLIES are swimming around the entrance to the building. You&rsquo;ll need to build up a strong social network to fight back!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-52" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Classics solved</h4>
        <p>The best thesis defense is a THESEUS OFFENSE! You slowly replace every part of the minotaur until he&rsquo;s no longer the monster who wanted to rule the Classics department.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-156" style="display:none;">

    </div>
    
    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-155" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Math open</h4>
        <p>The math department has been taken over by a pack of werewolves, led by WERE NUMBER ONE. They&rsquo;ve heard that there&rsquo;s strength in numbers, and they&rsquo;re taking this literally!
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-61" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Computer Science solved</h4>

        <h4>History solved</h4>
        <p>Of course! The history-muddling vampires are at their weakest in A CLERICAL ERA! You spray them down with holy water and they disappear, returning the timeline to its normal state.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-149" style="display:none;">
        <h4>History open</h4>
        <p>It&rsquo;s going to be tough to understand your History courses with these UNHOLY PREDATERS running around and messing with the past.

    </div>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-49" style="display:none;">
        <h4>English solved</h4>

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-150" style="display:none;">
        <h4>English open</h4>

        <h4>Music solved</h4>
        <p>You get the spirit to back down by threatening to DRUM KITS. She gathers her children and leaves, and as the door closes behind her you hear her say &ldquo;Mikon~!! Grow up to be the kind of kitsune who climb the ladder of success song by song...&rdquo;
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-154" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Music open</h4>
        <p>The vixen of the Music department, TAMAMO-NO-MAE WEST, is spreading disharmony and violins. You&rsquo;ll need to chordinate with your team to stave her off!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-63" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Economics solved</h4>
        <p>You SHUT ELECTRICAL DOWN, resulting in elec-trickle-down effects: Lore stops moving, Data comes to his senses, and the stock market goes back to making just as much sense as B-4.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-153" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Economics open</h4>
        <p>Lore took over the Econ department and has DATA TRADING - now all these numbers are moving way too fast for you to figure anything out.</p>
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="no-break story-chunk" id = "solved-10013" style="display:none;">
        <h4>Welcome to Monster University</h4>
        <p>You can&rsquo;t believe it! By discovering the message hidden in the placement test you&rsquo;ve revealed the fact that the Dean is a Martian! DEAN MARTIAN!  And now he wants to see you!  You head to his office and find him, looking a bit more green and antenna-y than you expected, sitting behind his large futuristic desk.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Ah, hello! I knew we had some bright enrollees this year, but you&rsquo;ve completely surpassed my expectations. In 23 years you are the first students to correctly finish the placement test and my secret is finally out – I&rsquo;m not quite &lsquo;of this Earth&rsquo;.  And I think you&rsquo;ll soon discover, neither are any of the department heads. In fact, allow me to be the first to welcome you... to Monster University! </p>
    
        <video controls style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9;" src="../static/images/stock/story_m.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    
    <p>You see, I found that normal human professors weren&rsquo;t getting the results I needed. Normal students weren&rsquo;t quite fitting the bill, either, so I decided to enact my master plan: harness the power of Earth&rsquo;s most incredible creatures – PUZZLERS! By finding the message I hid in the placement test you&rsquo;ve proven that you just might have what it takes to change the world!  Now get back to class and show me you&rsquo;ve got what it takes!&rdquo;</p>
    
        <p>You&rsquo;re not sure why, but you get the feeling that when Dean Martian says &ldquo;change the world&rdquo; he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean for the better!  Hopefully you can learn more by hitting the books.  It&rsquo;s time to find out what kinds of classes you&rsquo;re going to be taking.</p>
