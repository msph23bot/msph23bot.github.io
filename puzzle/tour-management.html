    <p>Here are posts from The Ultimate Cover Band roadie blog, from a tour that ran from Day 1 through Day 8. Unfortunately, the blog has managed to lose most of the actual dates. Can you manage to put the tour schedule back in order?</p>
<h3>Day 1 07:13</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited that our tour begins today! Before our first concert, all of us roadies went to see major league sporting events in same city as our concert. Some of us saw a game where the home team is named after a number, and the rest of us saw a game where the home team does not have the name of any city in its name. The band has something super rad planned for our fans at tonight&rsquo;s show. It&rsquo;s going to be epic!</p>
<h3>Day ? 04:05</h3>
<p>Last night was a much bigger crowd. We began the day by driving north on the same Interstate until we reached the next city with an NFL team, and then headed westbound on another Interstate. We continued through the next city that had an MLB team, and then a while after leaving the metro area, headed northwest on a state highway for about 25 miles.</p>
<h3>Day ? 06:09</h3>
<p>Last night&rsquo;s concert was amazing! This morning it was time to hit the road. First, we went south on a numbered US Route, then after a while we headed west on a 2-digit Interstate highway (we needed to drive on surface streets for a couple minutes to change highways), and then took that highway to a city right on the beach.</p>
<h3>Day ? 05:09</h3>
<p>Small but enthusiastic crowd at last night&rsquo;s show. We drove back to that interstate we crossed yesterday and went southbound on it. We drove until it ended at another Interstate, and we proceeded southbound on that one too and took it until it ended as well.</p>
<h3>Day ? 22:24</h3>
<p>The crowd last night was awesome! Today we drove south to the nearest airport, loaded our gear onto a plane, and then we flew to a US airport whose three-letter airport code had the same first letter as the three-letter code of the airport we left, and also had one of the other letters but in a different place. From there, we got a new tour bus and drove west to the nearest Interstate highway (whose number had three digits) and drove west on that. Once we reached an odd-numbered Interstate highway, we drove northwest on that highway and stayed on that highway for a little over 100 miles. Finally, we headed west on a three-digit palindromic state highway for about 10 miles. We couldn&rsquo;t wait to get off that tour bus and set up our next show!</p>
<h3>Day ? 04:17</h3>
<p>Well, that show was definitely an interesting experience! In the morning, we drove back to the same Interstate, and drove west until we reached a US Route with a number that we had driven on before on this road trip (but as an Interstate). We headed east on that US Route for about five miles.</p>
<h3>Day ? 01:09</h3>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s trip was a lot of work, but all the fans last night really made it all worthwhile! In the morning we drove back to the same Interstate and drove south on it. Then, by turning to the southwest, we switched onto an Interstate that shared two digits with the first one, and later we turned west to switch to an Interstate that shared two digits with that one. Then, soon after our path crossed the path of another Interstate highway, we headed about five miles east on a US Route and found tonight&rsquo;s venue nearby.</p>
<h3>Day 8 09:15</h3>
<p>Time to close out a highly successful tour; just one more venue! We drove back to that Interstate and drove westbound on it. At some point, we found ourselves near a state boundary and the road was concurrently labeled as an Interstate and 2 US Routes. We proceeded northwards on the US Route with the smaller number and set up for our last show in a city that is the largest in its state.</p>
