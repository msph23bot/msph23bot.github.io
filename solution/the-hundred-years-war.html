<p>The top half of the puzzle is a list of dates and date ranges (labeled “Day 1” through “Day 16”), and the bottom half is a 
list of questions like “Who won on day 17?” The questions don’t make any sense yet, so let’s start by looking up the dates.</p>
<p>A few of them should yield promising results: 2 September 31 BC was the Battle of Actium, 7 September 1812 was the Battle of 
Borodino, and so on. Guessing that these are all historical battles should make it possible to identify most of the others.</p>
<p>Many of the resulting battles, like Korsakov, Jargeau, Quebec, Xiapi, and Zurich, start with unusual letters, suggesting 
that it’s the names that are important rather than the actual historical details. The last letters, while less unusual, also 
seem to consist of a wide variety of letters. Filling the empty circles in each row with the first and last letters yields 
the following data:</p>

<p>This approach is confirmed by the notes: in the first battle, the circles are A and M, so east “wins” 13-1, and the first 
thirteen battles contain each letter of the alphabet once.</p>
<p>What’s going on after Day 13? The next letters that appear&mdash;W, M, R, A, S, and U&mdash;each occurred early on in the list, although 
not quite in that order. The key observation is that letters which appear together on one day seem to later appear on 
consecutive days on the same side of the list: Day 1 has A against M, while Days 14 and 15 have M and A on the right. Day 2 
has W against R, while Days 14 and 15 have W and R on the left. It looks like the same thing might be happening with the Day 
3 and 4 pairs, too, although Day 17’s data isn’t provided.</p>
<p>What could explain this? The flavor text mentions cards, and there’s a card game with this exact behavior: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)">War</a>! In a game of 
War, players simultaneously flip over a card from the tops of their decks. The player with the higher card takes both cards, 
and puts them on the bottom of their stack. War is normally played with a 52-card deck, but we’re playing with the alphabet 
instead. Later letters beat earlier ones, which is why A and M went to M’s side, and W and R went to W’s side. In the 
examples, and for the rest of the game, the winning card goes before the losing card at the bottom of the deck. (Normally, 
War also has rules for what to do in the case of a tie. Our deck doesn’t have ties, so we don’t have to worry about that.)</p>
<p>From now on, let’s call the players West and East. The first thirteen plays tell us the original deck order:</p>
<pre>
West:   AWSJBXLKFZQPG
East:   MRDUOIEVTHCYN
</pre>

<p>This allows us to simulate the rest of the game, but it’ll be easier if we do a little math first. </p>
<p>Playing out some turns (by hand, using spreadsheet formulas, or with a program) will reveal a few patterns: letters A-G are played every 14 turns, letters H-T are played every 13 turns, and letters U-Z are played every 12 turns. In fact, if we label those letters “L”, “M”, and “H” for “low”, “middle”, and “high”, the two decks are very similar:</p>
<pre>
West:   LHMMLHMMLHMML
East:   MMLHMMLHMMLHM
</pre>

<p>After one turn, we get:</p>
<pre>
West:   HMMLHMMLHMML
East:   MLHMMLHMMLHMML
</pre>

<p>And after another we get:</p>
<pre>
West:   MMLHMMLHMMLHM
East:   LHMMLHMMLHMML
</pre>

<p>This is exactly the original situation, but with the players reversed! After two more turns, we’re right back where we 
started, except the cards are permuted within each group: the Hs form two 3-cycles, the Ms form a 13-cycle, and the Ls a 
7-cycle. So this game repeats every 4*3*13*7 = 1092 turns. The flavor text was right: sometimes War never ends!</p>
<p>Fortunately, 1092 is a small enough number that we can list all possible game states. 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cSKZ19RmSnLYgDhZMbHpR2GvW0aYXYrGaIcYgvY1gMc/edit?usp=sharing">Here’s a spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<p>With this data, let’s attempt the final exam. Each question asks about the state of the game on one or more days, and the 
answer is a single letter.</p>
