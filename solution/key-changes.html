    <p>The “key changes” to perform are each common(-ish) puzzle hunt codes. Each one can be decoded to give the name of another 
encoding, so solvers can use this to identify the ones they’re missing. The encoded terms are in alphabetical order, but we 
can arrange the list to form one long loop, where each encoding decodes to the next one in the list: Maritime flags, 
Gold Bug, Pigpen, Ternary, Binary, NATO, Tap Code, Phone spelling, ASCII, Semaphore, A1Z26, Braille, Roman numerals, 
Elements, Morse code, and then back to Maritime flags again.</p>
<p>Below the key changes are a list of ways to “perform” these key changes. Each one can be interpreted as a way to transform 
one of these encodings. In a few of them, it also seems like the output is an encoded letter in another one of the fifteen 
codes.</p>
<p>With this in mind, solvers might guess that the output of “Replace the middle digit with ., increment the last digit, then 
write the name of that MacOS” is Sierra, a NATO alphabet letter. Sierra is version 10.12, which means the input is 
10[something]11. Interpreted as 5-bit binary, this could be an S or W.</p>
<p>At this point solvers should notice that each instruction can be interpreted to send a letter in one encoding to the next 
encoding in loop order. Given this, it’s easy to deduce the pairs for some transformations (e.g. “Make the background yellow,
 then cut the image in half” goes from Morse code to maritime signal flags). Others can be deduced by process of elimination.</p>
<p>Once the encodings are known for the instructions, solvers can then notice that for each instruction, there is exactly one 
letter which is mapped to the same letter in the new encoding. For example, if you count the number of 
yellow regions in <img src="key-changes/1.png" alt="The maritime signal flag for G: a square colored in alternating vertical stripes: yellow, blue, yellow, blue, yellow, blue."/>
(“G” in maritime signal flags), you get 3, which is the symbol for G in the gold bug cipher. No other letter has this 
property.</p>
<p>Here’s a table of all the letters that map to themselves:</p>

<p>The letters that are fixed by the transformations spell <span class="spoiler">GARY SINISE ON CSI</span>, which clues the 
answer <span class="spoiler">MAC TAYLOR</span>.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>This puzzle was inspired by the observation that semaphore for F, N, and U kind of look like their letters, that Braille 
and Morse I both consist of two dots (but oriented differently), and that semaphore I and U are both rotations of their 
pigpen analogues. None of these observations made it into the puzzle.</p>
<p>There are a number of interesting transformations that have two fixed points. For example, “count the dots from in each row 
from bottom to top” works for both A and N from braille to ternary, and “alphabetize all possible colors, and write 1 for 
each one that appears and 0 for each one that doesn’t” works for both F and J from maritime flags to binary.</p>
