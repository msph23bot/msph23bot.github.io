    <p>Each puzzle in the Sociology department uses parts of the profiles of two fish. This puzzle uses the memes on Octopus&rsquo;s Chumblr page, and the Flower Salesman section of Starfish&rsquo;s ReeledIn page.</p>
<p>This is an Einstein-style logic puzzle. Starfish&rsquo;s profile gives the setup: there are seven customers (including Stefanie) who bought seven types of flowers and live in seven houses on a street, each customer bought between 1 and 8 flowers, there were 35 total flowers sold, and somehow we&rsquo;re supposed to index into both the customers and the flowers.</p>
<p>Octopus&rsquo;s page has nine memes about these customers, which can be interpreted as clues:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Meme</th>
<th>Interpretation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Anakin &amp; Padm√©</td>
<td>The person who bought lavender and Glendora both bought the same prime number of flowers, and nobody else bought a prime number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assassination chain</td>
<td>Someone bought more flowers than Lysander, who bought one more flower than the person who purchased larkspur, who bought one more flower than the woman in house #5.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The trolley problem</td>
<td>The person who bought hyacinths bought more flowers than one person, and fewer flowers than the other five people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the same picture&rdquo;</td>
<td>The person who bought marigolds lives in the house numbered one less than Gabriela&rsquo;s house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gru&rsquo;s plan</td>
<td>Mordecai bought more flowers than his two neighbors combined, but didn&rsquo;t buy geraniums.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vince Mcmahon</td>
<td>There&rsquo;s a four-house chain of people who all bought even numbers of flowers, and the person who bought daffodils is at one end of that chain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s thinking about&rdquo;</td>
<td>The person in house #1 is the only person who bought flowers beginning with the same letter as their name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Drake yes/no</td>
<td>Leonardo doesn&rsquo;t live next to Herschel, but does live next to the person who bought wisteria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Draw 25 or</td>
<td>Herschel does not live next to the person who bought daffodils.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>The first step is to figure out the numbers of flowers that were bought. The only way to choose 3 consecutive numbers and one larger number (see meme #2) without using two different primes (see meme #1) is with 4, 5, 6, and 8. That means 5 is the repeated prime, so five of the numbers are 4, 5, 5, 6, and 8. That leaves 7 flowers left, and the only way to split those into two non-primes is 1 and 6. So the numbers are 1, 4, 5, 5, 6, and 8.</p>
<p>The other major constraint is the length 4 chain of even numbers. This must include house #5 (which we now know purchased 4 hyacinths), so it can&rsquo;t include house #1. So who can go in house #1, purchasing an odd number of flowers that start with the same letter as their name? It can&rsquo;t be Stefanie (there&rsquo;s no such flower), Mordecai (he has two neighbors), Gabriela (due to meme #4), Glendora (she bought 5 larkspurs), Herschel (hyacinths are at house #5), or Lysander (he bought 6 flowers). So Leonardo lives in house #1, and bought lavender.</p>
<p>Finally, where must the chain of four even-numbered flower purchasers be? Meme #2 now tells us that Glendora purchased 5 larkspurs, so the person in house #2 must have bought 1 flower or an even number of flowers. Mordecai is next to the person who bought 1 flower (see meme #5), so he's at one end of the chain. Mordecai can&rsquo;t be in house #2 or house #5, so the chain of even numbers goes from house #3 to house #6.</p>
<p>The remaining logic just involves straightforward applications of the facts from the memes. The solution is in the table below. Since each name and flower is 8 letters long, it&rsquo;s natural to index the flower purchases (which are also between 1 and 8) into them.</p>

<th>Name</th>
<th>Flower type</th>
<th>Flower #</th>
<th>Index into name</th>
<th>Index into flower</th>

<p>Reading these indexed letters in street order spells ANS <span class="spoiler">WILD ORCHIDS</span>.</p>
