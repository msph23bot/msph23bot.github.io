<p>This is a sequence of 13 minipuzzles. The first two are about Fibonacci-like sequences:</p>
<p><strong>Puzzle #1</strong>. These are sequences with the same recurrence as the Fibonacci numbers, where each number is the sum of the two
before it. The first two terms in each sequence are replaced by green question marks. The ?s can be identified by working 
backwards, and they can be read together as a two-digit number and converted to a letter (01=A, 26=Z) to get 
<span class="spoiler">SHRIMP</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Puzzle #2</strong>. This is another Fibonacci-like sequence, but you‚Äôre given the first few terms and must determine the 
second-to-last 15-digit number. It‚Äôs 512052201201518, which can be converted to letters to spell 
<span class="spoiler">ELEVATOR</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The remaining minipuzzles are a little unusual: each one doesn‚Äôt really make much sense on its own, and they all contain 
yellow and blue elements (in addition to the same green that the first two used for extraction).</p>
<p>At this point, solvers might notice that the third minipuzzle contains a shrimp and elevator emoji, so it‚Äôs natural to try to
use those answers to make sense of the instruction ‚Äú? ‚Üí ?‚Äù.</p>
<p>Indeed, this collection of minipuzzles is just like the Fibonacci sequence: each puzzle relies on the answers to the two 
puzzles before it. Those answers must be ‚Äúplugged in‚Äù to the yellow and blue parts of the puzzle, and the green part is the 
answer. Specifically, the blue part corresponds to the previous answer, and the yellow part corresponds to the answer before 
that.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #3</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">SHRIMP</span>, <span class="blue">ELEVATOR</span></p>
<p>This puzzle features a maze of emoji. The path from the ü¶ê to the üõó passes by the symbols üé∑ üêÆ üßÖ ü™ú üê∂ üßä üì∞ üçá, whose 
first letters spell <span class="spoiler">SCOLDING</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #4</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">ELEVATOR</span>, <span class="blue">SCOLDING</span></p>
<p>This puzzle consists of three rows of eight dots with various connecting arrows. Writing the eight-letter answers to the 
previous puzzles in the corresponding yellow and blue rows results in arrows from N to O and C to D. If we suppose that each 
other arrow also points from a letter to the one immediately after it in the alphabet, the green row spells 
<span class="spoiler">BESWARMS</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #5</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">SCOLDING</span>, <span class="blue">BESWARMS</span></p>
<p>The input words can each be read as one word inside another word: COLD in SING, and WARM in BESS. Fill those words into the 
corresponding spaces to get two clues: [Part that may SING like BESS] is a SOPRANO, and [Study of COLD and WARM] is 
THERMODYNAMICS. Enter those answers in the blanks and read the resulting numbers to get <span class="spoiler">NANOMITES</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #6</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">BESWARMS</span>, <span class="blue">NANOMITES</span></p>
<p>Fill in the letters of NANOMITES in the blue grid. The instructions suggest starting at the start of the yellow answer (the ‚ÄúB‚Äù space), and then following the compass directions in the yellow answer (E, S, W, S). The letters along the path spell <span class="spoiler">ANIME</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #7</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">NANOMITES</span>, <span class="blue">ANIME</span></p>
<p>The instruction ‚ÄúTarts ta Connill Notyuc‚Äù can have its words anagrammed to read ‚ÄúStart at Lincoln County‚Äù, but which one? The two input words can be anagrammed to spell MINNESOTA and MAINE. Follow the listed steps from Lincoln County in those states, and index into the counties along the path. In Minnesota, the sequence is Yellow <strong>M</strong>edicine, L<strong>a</strong>c qui Parle, <strong>S</strong>wift, Kandi<strong>y</strong>ohi,  Stea<strong>r</strong>ns, Do<strong>u</strong>glas, <strong>P</strong>ope. In Maine it's Saga<strong>d</strong>ahoc, <strong>A</strong>ndroscoggin, Ke<strong>n</strong>nebec, Waldo, <strong>H</strong>ancock, Penobsc<strong>o</strong>t, <strong>W</strong>ashington. This spells MASYRUP DAN HOW. Anagram each word one last time to get PYRAMUS AND WHO, which clues the answer <span class="spoiler">THISBE</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #8</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">ANIME</span>, <span class="blue">THISBE</span></p>
<p>The words ANIME and THISBE can be broken up into five of the hundred most common words in English (according to the Oxford 
English Corpus): AN, I, ME, THIS, and BE. Place them in order and find the words before or after them as indicated in the 
list, then read the numbered spaces to spell <span class="spoiler">ANGELO</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #9</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">THISBE</span>, <span class="blue">ANGELO</span></p>
<p>The two six-letter inputs can be written on the yellow and blue lines. Reading down, we have 2 out of 3 letters which are 
described by rather vague clues for the words HAN, LEO, LAB, GIS, PAT, and SEC. Fill in the missing letters and the green 
line spells <span class="spoiler">PASCAL</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #10</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">ANGELO</span>, <span class="blue">PASCAL</span></p>
<p>Place the yellow and blue inputs into their blanks to get two mystery functions: ANGEL ‚ûú ANGELO adds an O to the end of a 
word, and PINGALA ‚ûõ PASCAL replaces a surname of a person who invented a mathematical concept with the surname of the Blaise 
after whom it was named. Apply the same functions to the third line to get BELLAS ‚ûú BELLASO ‚ûõ 
<span class="spoiler">VIGENERE</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #11</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">PASCAL</span>, <span class="blue">VIGENERE</span></p>
<p>This puzzle consists of three clues, and the last one suggests that they‚Äôre about chemical elements. The yellow A, B, and C 
should be read as Pa, Sc, and Al, while the blue D, E, F, G, and H should be read as V, I, Ge, Ne, and Re. Resolve the clues 
to identify the green I, J, and K as Se, Ne, and Ca, so the answer is <span class="spoiler">SENECA</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #12</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">VIGENERE</span>, <span class="blue">SENECA</span></p>
<p>VIGENERE is the lock, and SENECA is the key: decrypt the text XMSXJ using the Vigen√®re key SENECA to get the answer 
<span class="spoiler">FIFTH</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Puzzle #13</strong>. Inputs: <span class="yellow">SENECA</span>, <span class="blue">FIFTH</span></p>
<p>This is a map of downtown Seattle. Carefully resize the image and overlay it on a map so that the yellow and blue lines are 
Seneca St. and 5th Ave. while the upper-left X is the Space Needle. The other X lies on the tattoo parlor Letters + Lowlows,
so the answer is <span class="spoiler">LETTERS</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Meta</strong>. Just like the minipuzzles, the previous two answers tell us what to do: reading the fifth letters of SHRIMP, 
ELEVATOR, SCOLDING, BESWARMS, NANOMITES, ANIME, THISBE, ANGELO, PASCAL, VIGENERE, SENECA, FIFTH, and LETTERS spells the final
answer <span class="spoiler">MADAME BLANCHE</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>The original plan was to have this be a sequence of crossword clues, with the same overall structure where each answer feeds 
into the next two clues. It turns out that this isn‚Äôt particularly easy to construct! Inspired by 
<a href="https://puzzlehunt.club.cc.cmu.edu/puzzle/19036/">This Puzzle Will Unlock In‚Ä¶</a>, we instead went with a collection of 
minipuzzles.</p>
<p>Writing this puzzle, working backwards from the end, is like playing eleven very tiny games of 
<a href="https://www.ericberlin.com/2022/01/04/spaghetti-time/">Spaghetti</a>. At each phase, you‚Äôve got one constrained answer (e.g. 
ANIME), and your job is to figure out a property of that answer which can become a puzzle (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an anagram of a state!‚Äù). 
We had to cheat a few times (especially with the Vigen√®re bit), but overall I‚Äôm pleased with the variety of answer usage.</p>
<p>In early January, we noticed that this puzzle and <a href="../puzzle/ph22.html">Blue Moons</a> both contained the clue phrase FIFTH LETTERS. The puzzles were sufficiently far apart in the hunt that we decided not to do anything about it. Then, just a few weeks before the event, we solved <em>another</em> puzzle in <em>another</em> hunt with the same clue phrase. We now declare FIFTH LETTERS to be the official clue phrase of 2023, and we look forward to solving many more puzzles this year with the same extraction.</p>
