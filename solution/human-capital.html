    <p>In this puzzle, each line represents the first letters in a statement about a famous person who goes professionally by a name with an initial.<br />
In addition, each clue has a letter replaced by 'X'. <br />
The initials for the famous people spell the cluephrase WORK OVER TIME (POWER, as in physics, work (N*m) divided by time (s) = power)</p>
<p>The 'X' letters in order spell the cluephrase GROWN UP DUDE (MAN)</p>
<p>Each underscore is a word. They are there to help parse the cluephrases (so WORK OVER TIME vs WORK OVERTIME). The . refers to the initials of the people in the statements, and X is the substituted letter. The + is just concatenation of the answers to each cluephrase.
<p>Concatenating the the parts gives the answer</p>
<div class="spoiler">MANPOWER</div>
