    <p>In the Sociology round, each puzzle comes from the profiles for two of the five sea creatures. Thus, each sea creature has 
four answers. These four answers form a sub-meta, where each answer extracts a letter in a way hinted at by the name of the 
creature.</p>
<h3>Hammerhead</h3>
<p>Each answer is cryptic wordplay for a letter.</p>
<p>EARLY CAMBRIAN: C (beginning of CAMBRIAN)</p>
<p>TALK BACK: K (end of TALK)</p>
<p>YOUNG AT HEART: U (middle of YOUNG)</p>
<p>DEEP END: P (end of DEEP)</p>
<h3>Octopus</h3>
<p>Each answer contains two (possibly diagonal) compass directions, one at the start and one at the end, which can be read as 
semaphore.</p>
<p>EARLY CAMBRIAN: J (East-North)</p>
<p>WRACK ZONE: Q (West-Northeast)</p>
<p>WILD ORCHIDS: B (West-South)</p>
<p>SHIITAKE: F (South-East)</p>
<h3>Salmon</h3>
<p>Each answer contains a silent "dummy letter".</p>
<p>TALK BACK: L</p>
<p>WRACK ZONE: W</p>
<p>THE LISTENER: T</p>
<p>BUSINESS: I</p>
<h3>Starfish</h3>
<p>Each answer is a movie title starring an alliterative actress.</p>
<p>YOUNG AT HEART: D (Doris Day)</p>
<p>WILD ORCHIDS: G (Greta Garbo)</p>
<p>THE LISTENER: T (Tessa Thompson)</p>
<p>ARRIVAL: A (Amy Adams)</p>
<h3>Tuna</h3>
<p>Each answer contains a double letter.</p>
<p>DEEP END: E</p>
<p>SHIITAKE: I</p>
<p>BUSINESS: S</p>
<p>ARRIVAL: R</p>
<p>The meta page shows ten pairs of fish, each with a thought bubble. In each pair, the left fish&rsquo;s thought bubble contains a letter, and the right fish&rsquo;s thought bubble is blank. For each answer, we can find a unique fish on the left column which is thinking of one of its letters, and write the other letter extracted from that answer in the other bubble:</p>

<p>The letters extracted from the fish on the right spell the answer, <span class="spoiler">CLIQUE BAIT</span>.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>This meta went through so many drafts that we had to enlist <em>four</em> different outside groups to alpha test it, because so many of the other authors got spoiled on earlier versions.</p>
<p>The idea of having five different letter extraction mechanics came fairly early, but it was less obvious how I should take the resulting 20 letters and turn them into a 10-letter answer phrase. The first few drafts involved finding the <em>differences</em> between the extracted letters in each fish. However, there’s no internal confirmation that you&rsquo;re doing the right thing, so if you get one fish mechanic wrong you get nonsense letters, but it&rsquo;s unclear where the mistake is. The new shell gives half of the extracted letters, making it easier to detect when something is wrong.</p>
<p>Another difference was flavor text. In early versions, there was flavor text cluing each fish&rsquo;s mechanic. This meant that it was easy to get all of the mechanics with one or two examples. Most testers were able to guess CLIQUE BAIT with just 3 or 4 letters, and I didn&rsquo;t want the meta to be solvable with just 3 or 4 answers. I changed to the pared down version, where the only hint to each fish&rsquo;s mechanic is its name, so a lot of answers are needed before patterns emerge.</p>
<p>The removal of flavor text meant that the set of fish had to change a lot: there&rsquo;s really no good way to clue the old Tuna&rsquo;s &ldquo;find the solfège note in the 7-letter answer, then use it as an index&rdquo; (e.g. REPO MAN = E, EXAMINE = A) with just a name. So that was replaced with Hammerhead, and Grouper was renamed to Tuna. But then Sturgeon&rsquo;s &ldquo;find the letter you can delete to make a new word&rdquo; (e.g. WHINE = H, MARIE = I) wouldn&rsquo;t cooperate with Hammerhead: one really wants answers to be one word, while the other wants them to be two or more. Thus Salmon was born.</p>
<p>In the final version, testers generally found Octopus&rsquo;s mechanic to be the hardest, and Tuna&rsquo;s to be the easiest. I tried to balance this by making Octopus&rsquo;s puzzles easy to identify. Meanwhile, Tuna got a bunch of audio clips, which most teams put off until the end.</p>
